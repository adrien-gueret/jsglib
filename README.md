# JSGlib
> If you know how to build a website, you know how to develop a videogame

JSGlib is a small JavaScript library helping you to develop browser-based videogames. Its main purpose is to be the simplest to use as possible:
no needs to be a JavaScript expert to develop a game with JSGlib: **basic knowledge of HTML ans CSS is sufficient!**

## How does it work?

Contrary to most of similar tools, JSGlib does not rely on `<canvas>` tag, but on web components.

The browser is already a rendering engine, thanks to web languages we can do whatever we want:

- display texts and images with HTML
- running animations with CSS
- handling interactions events with JavaScript

With JSGlib, you define your game elements with web components, and you listen to events in a pure and vanilla JavaScript way.
We let all the drawing complexity and headaches to the browser!
