> If you know how to build a website, you know how to develop a videogame

JSGLib is a small JavaScript library helping you to develop browser-games. Its main purpose is to be the simplest to use as possible.

No needs to be a JavaScript expert to develop a game with JSGLib: **basic knowledge of HTML and CSS is sufficient!**

## How does it work?

Contrary to most of similar tools, JSGLib does not rely on `<canvas>` tag, but on web components.

The browser is already a rendering engine. Thanks to web languages, we can do whatever we want:

- displaying texts and images with HTML
- running animations with CSS
- handling interactions events with JavaScript

With JSGlib, you define your game elements with web components, and you listen to events with vanilla JavaScript.  
We let all the drawing complexity and headaches to the browser!
